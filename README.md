# Course Registration System (C++)
This is a simple console-based program written in **C++** to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## Features
- Allows a student to register for available courses.
- Displays course details like course code, title and credits.
- Shows a confirmation message when registration is successful.
- Demonstrates core OOP concepts: **Encapsulation**, **Classes**, and **Composition**.

## Classes Used
- **Course** → stores course code, title and credits.  
- **Student** → stores student name and ID.  
- **Registration** → connects a student with a course and confirms registration.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **Dev C++** or any C++ IDE.
2. Open the file named 'course_registration.cpp'.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Enter:
   - Student Name  
   - Student ID  
   - Course choice (1 or 2)
5. The program will confirm your registration.

## Example Courses
- Course Code: 101', Title: 'Database Management'. 
- Course Code: '102', Title: 'Data Structures'.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation** – Using private data and public methods.  
- **Constructors** – Initializing objects easily.  
- **Object Interaction** – Student and Course linked through Registration.
